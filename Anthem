What's the name of the administrator?

http://10.10.32.198/archive/a-cheers-to-our-it-department/

During our hard times our beloved admin managed to save our business by redesigning the entire website.

As we all around here knows how much I love writing poems I decided to write one about him:

Born on a Monday,
Christened on Tuesday,
Married on Wednesday,
Took ill on Thursday,
Grew worse on Friday,
Died on Saturday,
Buried on Sunday.
That was the endâ€¦
