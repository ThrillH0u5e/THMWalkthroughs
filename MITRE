 CAR - Cyber Analytics Repository - a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE based on the MITRE ATT&CK速 adversary model. 
 
reference -  https://car.mitre.org/analytics/CAR-2020-09-001/
 
Here we're provided with Pseudocode and a query on how to search for this specific analytic within Splunk. A pseudocode is a plain, human-readable way to describe a set of instructions or algorithms that a program or system will perform.

References previous room Sysmon (host-level tracing tool that can help detect advance threats on your network. In contrast to AV/HIDS - sysmon performs system activity deep monitoring and logs high-confidence indicators of advanced attacks.

MITRE ENGAGE

"framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations that empowers you to engage your adversaries and achieve your cybersecurity goals"

Adversary Engagement Approach accomplished by the implementation of:
 Cyber Denial - prevents adversary's ability to conduct their operations
 Cyber Deception - intentionally plant artifacts to mislead adversary
 
 "Starter kit" is a collection of whitepapers and PDFs explaining various checklists, methodologies, and processes to get you started. 
 
 Engage Matrix
 
   * Prepare the set of operational actions that will lead to your desired outcome (input)
   * Expose adversaries when they trigger your deployed deception activities 
   * Affect adversaries by performing actions that will have a negative impact on their operations
   * Elicit information by observing the adversary and learn more about their modus operandi (TTPs)
   * Understand the outcomes of the operational actions (output) 
   
QUESTIONS:

Under Prepare, what is ID SAC0002? (ref: https://engage.mitre.org/matrix/)
Persona Creation

What is the name of the resource to aid you with the engagement activity from the previous question?
Persona Profile Worksheet (Had to look at the hint on this one. Tool > All Tools > Persona Profile Worksheet)

Which engagement activity baits a specific response from the adversary?

Lures

WHat is the definition of a threat model?

A risk assessment that models organizational strengths and weaknesses  (Found: https://engage.mitre.org/matrix/?activity=threat-model)

P.A.S.,S0598 ( Found: https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library/tree/master/sandworm/Emulation_Plan/Scenario_1)

ATT&CK and Threat Intelligence:
Threat Intelligence (TI) or Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is the information, or TTPs, attributed to the adversary.

Some threat intel can be open source or through a subscription with a vendor, such as CrowdStrike. In contrast, many defenders wear multiple hats (roles) within some organizations, and they need to take time from their other tasks to focus on threat intelligence.

QUESTIONS:
What is a group that targets your sector who has been in operation since at least 2013? 
APT33 (MITRE ATT&CK > Groups)

As your organization is migrating to the cloud, is there anything attributed to this APT group that you should focus on? If so, what is it?

Cloud Accounts

What tool is associated with the technique from the previous question?
 Ruler (attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)
 
Per the detection tip, what should you be detecting? (format: phrase1 or phrase2)
